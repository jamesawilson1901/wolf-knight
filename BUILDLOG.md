# Build Log — Wolf Knight

Decisions made during the build, phase by phase. Specs live in `./design`; this file
records where judgement calls were made.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold (2026-07-09)

**Goal:** static-file scaffold (no bundler), vendored three.js + import map, PWA shell
(manifest + service worker), one lit volcanic test room from real kit pieces, fixed 3/4
camera. Deployable to GitHub Pages from the repo root.

### Decisions

- **three.js 0.185.1** (latest stable at build time), vendored from the official npm
  tarball into `./vendor`. The min build is split since r167: `three.module.min.js`
  imports `./three.core.min.js`, so both are vendored side by side. `GLTFLoader.js`
  imports `three`, `../utils/BufferGeometryUtils.js` and `../utils/SkeletonUtils.js`,
  so both utils are vendored under `vendor/addons/utils/`. Import map in `index.html`
  maps `three` → `./vendor/three.module.min.js` and `three/addons/` → `./vendor/addons/`
  (the standard three.js addon prefix). Verified the import graph is closed — no other
  external imports.
- **All URLs are relative** (`./…`) everywhere — index.html, import map, sw.js precache,
  manifest `start_url`/`scope` — because GitHub Pages serves project sites from a
  subpath (`/<repo>/`). Nothing may assume a root path.
- **Test room built from real kit pieces** (hard rule: no invented paths; all filenames
  inspected after extracting the zips to `./asset-raw`, which is gitignored):
  - Kenney **Nature Kit** `ground_grass.glb` → `assets/env/floor-tile.glb` (1×1 m tile);
    `rock_large[A-C].glb`, `rock_small[A-B].glb` → boulders; `cliff_block_rock.glb` →
    wall ring.
  - Kenney **Castle Kit** `wall-pillar.glb` → `assets/env/pillar.glb`. Castle GLBs
    reference an external `Textures/colormap.png`, so that texture is copied alongside
    at `assets/env/Textures/colormap.png` (GLTFLoader resolves it relative to the GLB).
    Nature Kit GLBs are fully self-contained (plain colored materials, no textures).
- **Volcanic retint in code:** Kenney's meadow-green materials are retinted by material
  name (`grass`→ashen moss, `dirt`→scorched earth, `stone`→basalt, castle `colormap`
  texture multiplied darker). One shared tinted material instance per name (cached),
  so draw-call state stays small. This implements the "dark volcanic materials" spec
  without touching the asset files.
- **Floor and wall ring are `InstancedMesh`** (one draw call each: 192 floor tiles,
  60 wall blocks) — phone-friendly from day one. Tiles/blocks get deterministic 90°
  rotation + height variation (no `Math.random`, so every load looks identical).
- **Light rig per spec:** hemisphere fill + one warm key directional with a tight
  1024² shadow map (PCFSoft). Plus a pulsing emissive **lava pool** with an orange
  point light — a Phase-0 taste of the region's signature "lava lights the cave" look
  (ASSETS.md calls for exactly this technique).
- **Camera:** perspective 50° FOV, pitched 50° down, fixed on the room (smooth-follow
  arrives with Kael in Phase 1).
- **Renderer:** `devicePixelRatio` capped at 2, antialias on.
- **Service worker:** cache-first with a versioned cache name (`wolfknight-vX.Y.Z` —
  bump on every deploy), full precache of vendor/js/assets, runtime caching of
  same-origin GETs, offline navigation falls back to `index.html`. `skipWaiting` +
  `clients.claim` so phase updates roll out on next reload.
- **PWA icons** generated as original art (ember crescent moon over volcanic ridge,
  512/192/180 px) with a small pure-Node PNG writer — no creature art, no asset-pack
  content, so no licence concerns.
- **Landscape-only** is enforced softly for now: manifest `orientation: landscape` +
  a CSS "rotate your device" overlay in portrait. (Hard lock where supported comes
  with the polish phase.)
- **Error surfacing:** a visible error overlay catches window errors and asset-load
  failures — makes phone verification much easier than a blank screen.

### Verification

- Served locally and screenshot-tested in headless Chromium (desktop + phone-landscape
  viewport): room renders lit, no console errors, service worker registers and
  precaches all 21 URLs, manifest parses.
- Two real bugs caught by screenshot iteration: Kenney GLBs export `metallicFactor: 1`
  (fully metallic renders black away from direct light — forced `metalness = 0` in the
  material pass), and multi-material Kenney GLBs are multi-primitive (instancing only
  the first mesh dropped the cliff blocks' side faces — instancing now covers every
  primitive).
- Two more caught by an adversarial multi-agent review pass: (1) `cache.addAll` fetches
  through the browser HTTP cache (GitHub Pages serves `max-age=600`), so a deploy could
  fill a fresh cache version with stale files — precache requests now use
  `cache: 'reload'`; (2) the pillars were lifted 0.6 units into the air because the GLB
  bounds were read from the NORMAL accessor (±1) instead of POSITION (0..1.31) — the
  pillar base already sits at y=0. Lesson recorded: when inspecting GLB bounds, filter
  accessors to the POSITION attribute only.
